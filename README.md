# Network Size and Green Technology Innovation

## Overview - Theory of Change & Research Question

As the world continues to see and feel the impacts of climate change, including urban smog, more frequent forest fires, rising ocean temperatures, and more frequent and stronger hurricanes, ensuring green technology innovation is as successful and as efficient as possible constitutes an increasingly high priority. Our group was interested in how the geographic dispersal of researchers affected this efficiency. Empirical evidence from previous studies has borne out that the number of patents produced in a given place is directly correlated with population at increasing returns to scale. Researchers have theorized that these increasing returns are partially the result of the informal connections and interactions that larger metropolitan areas facilitate, as well as the thicker employment markets found there. Collaboration between academia and industry is likely also more easily facilitated in these areas in which industry actors are typically located.

**Articulated simply, our research question asks:** 

Does professional network size matter in innovation?

## Methodology: Quantifying Innovation through Patents

Our outcome of interest is the number of patents produced within a given city as a function of the number of PIs (and associated researchers) and the dollar amount of grants received.
